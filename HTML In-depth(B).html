        <li><strong>14 March, 1879 -&nbsp;</strong>Albert Einstein is a German-born theoretical physicist
            widely known to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>1900 - 1906 - &nbsp;</strong> Einstein's paper "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen"
            ("Conclusions
            from the Capillarity Phenomena") was published in the journal Annalen der Physik. On 30 April 1905
            Einstein completed his dissertation, A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions with Alfred Kleiner,
            serving as pro-forma advisor. His thesis was accepted in July 1905, and Einstein was awarded a PhD on 15
            January 1906.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><small>xx xx </small>1908 -&nbsp;</strong>He was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed
            lecturer at the
            University of Bern. The following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity
            principle
            at the University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship
            in
            theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.
            <blockquote><b>“The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.
                    One
                    cannot help but be in awe when one contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the
                    marvellous
                    structure of reality. It is enough if one tries to comprehend only a little of this mystery every
                    day.”</b>
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>1912 - 1914 - &nbsp;</strong>He was a professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he
            taught
            analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat,
            and
            the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><small>xx xx </small>1922 -&nbsp;</strong>He was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his
            services to
            Theoretical
            Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".
            <blockquote><b>“Try not to become a man of success. Rather become a man of value.”</b></blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>February & March 1993 -&nbsp;</strong>The Gestapo repeatedly raided his family's apartment in
            Berlin. He
            and his wife Elsa returned to Europe in March, and during the trip, they learned that the German Reichstag
            had
            passed the Enabling Act on 23 March, transforming Hitler's government into a de facto legal dictatorship,
            and
            that they would not be able to proceed to Berlin.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>3 October 1933&nbsp;</strong>Einstein delivered a speech on the importance of academic freedom
            before a
            packed
            audience at the Royal Albert Hall in London, with The Times reporting he was wildly cheered throughout.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>1940 -&nbsp;</strong>Einstein became an American citizen
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>1946 - &nbsp;</strong>Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black
            college,
            where he was awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant
            college
            degrees to African Americans; alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall. Einstein gave a speech
            about
            racism in America, adding, "I do not intend to be quiet about it."

        <li>
            <strong>17 April, 1955 -&nbsp;</strong>Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an
            abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948.
